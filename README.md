The SunMap project arises from the final degree project in computer science at the Complutense University of Madrid.

This tool allows you to edit on a set of images at the same time, allowing you to store the result of the edits in GIF format.

The highlight of the application is the transformations, which allow the development of synoptic maps from a sequence of images.

This first version, developed in Python code, allows to obtain a light solar image editing tool, offering two modes, one in graphical interface (crossEditorGraphic) and the other on terminal (batch).

You can install all the dependencies of the program with the installation executable, which contains a list of pip commands.

To be able to use the program, a 64-bit architecture is required, python installed for said architecture and with a version 3.7.8 or lower.
